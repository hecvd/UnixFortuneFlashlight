UnixFortuneFlashlight
=====================

Unix fortune implementation for android... and a flash torch switch.

I used some Unix fortune files I found here and there and most of the ones included in the Ubuntu fortune package.

I did a very basic implementation of strfile using python and outputting the .dat files on json.
There's a lot of room from improvement, but works fairly well for now.


Stuff I'd like to add:

--More effects.

--Share button to twitter, facebook, etc. The app must generate an image before sharing.

--2 widgets. One to turn the flash light on/off and other to show random fortunes. 
	Maybe one that can do both? I don't know.

--Standard Unix fortune options.
